# Coolify (v3)

[Coolify](https://coolify.io) is a self-hostable, all-in-one solution to host your applications, databases, or other open-source services with a few simple clicks.

It's an alternative software to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and other alternatives out there.


## Features
- Deploy `Static, NodeJS, Svelte, React, Vue, Next, Nuxt, Astro, PHP, Rust, and more` applications hassle-free with automatic reverse proxy and free SSL certificates.
- One-click `MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, RedisDB` instances ready to use, locally or over the internet.
- One-click and deploy your own instance of `WordPress, Ghost, Plausible Analytics, NocoDB, BitWarden/VaultWarden, LanguageTool, N8n, VSCode Server, and more`.
- Deploy any of these resources to a `Local Docker Engine` or `Remote Docker Engine`.
- Integration with `GitHub`, `GitLab`, `hosted` or `self-hosted versions`.
- `Automagically deploy new commits` and `pull requests` separately to quickly review contributions and speed up your teamwork!
- You can manage teams easily with our `new team management system`. Each team is separated by a namespace, and you can create as many teams as you want.
- Upgrade your all-in-one IaaS platform with one button!

## Who is it for?
1. Companies and teams who would like to host their resources in-house. ðŸ›–
2. Hobbyists to quickly run your applications and ship that MVP! ðŸš¢
3. For everyone who would not like to rely on huge cloud providers for any reason. â›…
4. Or for anyone who likes cool software. ðŸ˜Ž
5. Who would like to migrate from Heroku. âš¡

## Who is using it?
