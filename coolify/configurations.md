# Configurations

All data that is configured or used by Coolify is available on the host filesystem. If something goes wrong with Coolify, you will be still able to manage your applications.

This includes:

- Deployment related configurations, like `docker-compose.yaml` files.
- SSH Related configurations.
- Proxy configurations.

## Persistent Directories

| Type                        | Host System                 | Inside Coolify's container                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Base                        | `/data/coolify`             | `/var/www/html/app/storage/coolify`             |
| [Deployments](#deployments) | `/data/coolify/deployments` | `/var/www/html/app/storage/coolify/deployments` |
| [SSH Related Configs](#ssh) | `/data/coolify/ssh`         | `/var/www/html/app/storage/coolify/ssh`         |
| [Proxy](#proxy)             | `/data/coolify/proxy`       | `/var/www/html/app/storage/coolify/proxy`       |

### Deployments

You can always find the latest successfully deployed application details in the `latest` directory.

```bash{3}
├── deployments
│   ├── my-first-application
│   │   ├── latest
│   │   │   ├── docker-compose.yaml
│   │   │   ├── .env
│   │   ├── <deployment timestamp>
│   │   ├── <deployment timestamp>
│   │   ├── <deployment timestamp>
│   ├── my-second-application
│   │   ├── latest
│   │   │   ├── docker-compose.yaml
│   │   ├── <deployment timestamp>
```

### SSH

Coolify stores two things here:
1. Private SSH keys used to connect to Coolify's host server and all remote servers.
2. Muliplexed SSH connection related temporary files.

### Proxy

1. `docker-compose.yaml` file to manage the proxy.

#### Traefik v2
1. `acme.json` that has all the SSL certificates.
2. `dynamic` configurations, generated by Coolify or manually by you.
